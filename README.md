# Interkassa
An Interkassa payment gateway for FOSSBilling.
We've been told this doesn't work, however the Interkassa API seems to still match what is used in this payment gateway, so YMMV.
FOSSBilling doesn't currently have plans to maintain this payment gateway, however we'd be happy to review changes by the community
